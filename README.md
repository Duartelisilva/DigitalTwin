For my thesis project, I worked on the development of a digital twin of a 1:43 scale autonomous racing system using Unity. I created the virtual environment and assets, as well as integrating them into a functional simulation.

I modeled the race track and race cars in Blender, ensuring they accurately represented the real-world system, and imported them into Unity to build the simulation environment. Within Unity, I set up the scene, scaling, physics, and interactions required for the digital twin to function correctly. The final environment supports real-time simulation, visualization, and monitoring of the race cars, serving as a foundation for testing control systems and machine learning algorithms in a safe, virtual setting.

This project allowed me to combine 3D modeling and game engine development while working on a realistic simulation with real-world applications.

*Final Race Track Design made in Blender*

Checkpoints were added to the race track in order to ensure the cars wouldn't cheat and cross over terrain.

*Checkpoints in the Race Track*

Statistics were calculated and displayed on the screen, with the internet to see details on the car's behavior on the race track in real time.

*Statistics Displayed on the screen*

Various values were also stored in a file, like the timestamp, speed, and position of each car, so that they could be used for Machine Learning development using these values.

*Values Inserted in the Database*

Unity could communicate with the real-life cars, and thus when an instruction was sent, the virtual counterpart would move accordingly, mirroring the movement and position of each other.
